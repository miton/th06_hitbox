Some people when playing [東方紅魔郷 ～ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil](http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil) lament the fact that it does not have a *hitbox indicator* displayed while you are in focused mode like later games in the series. One solution to this was to edit the sprites for the player characters and paint a dot where the indicator would be. Still, some people were not happy. The dot would always be present (even while not in focused mode) and they found it distracting. This version of a "hitbox patch" attempts to remedy such problems. It modifies the game to add a hitbox indicator and tries to mimic the appearance and behaviour of some amalgam of the indicators in subsequent games (notably, changing size and transparency, only being visible while focused, and --most importantly-- spinning) and should always be in the correct spot (which the painted on version is sometimes not).

Requires version 1.02h and should work with or without the English patch.

Usage
----------------

Just place d3d8.dll and hitbox.png the same directory as the game.

Bugs
----------------

If you change resolutions with the F11 key while playing it will crash.

This work is based upon a version [Michael Koch's DirectX 8 Direct3D 'proxy.dll'](http://www.mikoweb.eu/index.php?node=28) which was released into the public domain.

The included .png was taken from the sprite sheets of one of the other games. Apologies to ZUN.
